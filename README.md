Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its a systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operations, maintenance and modification of software. Its important as it enables the development of software applications for individuals or businesses.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages and foundation of software development in the 1960s
In the 1970s was the beginning of structured programming
Then, In the early 2000s Agile methodologies was introduced

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- this is gathering and documenting software requirements and user requirements
Design- creating high leveled design of the software architecture and blueprints
Development- It is the building of software applications and writing code
Testing- Its identifying and fixing of errors to improve on the quality fo the software
Deployment - Releasing the software to end users
Maintenance - Fixing bugs, updating and providing ongoing support

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall- It is a linear sequential process that requires each phase is completed before moving to the next phase. It is suitable for projet that does not require a lot of changes and that has well defined requirements
Agile- Its an approach that emphasizes on flexibility and collaboration with the customer. It is better suited for projects with uncertain outcomes

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Writes, tests and maintains software code
Quality Assurance Engineer -  The ensure that the software is of good quality by testing and identifying errors
Project Manager - They cordinate the teams and resources and oversee the software development process

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. E.G. Visual Studio Code
IDEs- Its an environment that provides tools for writing code, debugging, testing and improving the productivity of a developer.
VCS- Manage changes to source code over timeIt enables collaboration and it prevents conflicts. E.G. Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Adapting to changing requirements. This can be overcome through continous learning and skill development
Maintaing quality of a sofware- This can be solved by having vigorous testing and quality assuarance processes
Meeting Deadlines- This can be solved through effective management and planning

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - Testing individual components and modules of the software
Integration Testing - Testing how different modules or parts interact with the software
System Testing - This involves evaluating the whole system to ensure it meets requirements
Acceptance Testing - This is to verify that the software meets the need of the end users

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Its the art of creating ar writing an effective promp to guide AI models to generate desired outputs. Its important as it leads to accurate and relevant outputs and its also efficient.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vage prompt - write something about the environment
Improved prompt- Discuss the impact of climate change on global food security.
This improved prompt is effective as it clearly defines the topic and it provides a specific focus and it avoids ambiguity
